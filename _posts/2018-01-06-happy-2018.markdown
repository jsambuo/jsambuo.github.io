Hi, remember me? It's been a while. How have you been?

A lot has happened over the years. Mostly good, some not so much.

I've had so many thoughts, and I always say I should write them down, but I never do. Today is a good day to restart that.

I've been feeling pretty productive recently, getting to inbox zero (again), and getting tasks done, some that I've been putting off for a long time. I'm about to head to the dentist, and I thought I had ten minutes free, so I should get used to blogging again. Here I am. Did you miss me? Hopefully I'll continue this trend longer than a few days.

Wishing you a Happy New Year. May this year be better than the last.
